# DragonFlame-Rockets

Here we have our first rockets, the **DragonFlames**, and we share the STL files and plain projects.

We don't share the DragonFlame I, DragonFlame II and DragonFlame III because of malfunctions, projects lost or other types of errors found after the releasing of the rockets.

If you are wondering how to remote-launch your rocket, see our [ESP32-Rocket-Base](https://github.com/Space-Propulsion-Laboratory/ESP32-Rocket-Base) project.
