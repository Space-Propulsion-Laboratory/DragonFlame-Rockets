# DragonFlame IV

The DragonFlame IV is our first customizable 3D printed rocket.

You can change it's form and height by just not printing the body, getting a smaller, 5 grams rocket.

It's body is compact and empty, to carry some little weight around, and for some custom PCBs to get the state of the rocket.
