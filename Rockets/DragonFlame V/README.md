# DragonFlame V **Beta**

The DragonFlame V Rocket is made for carrying some sensors and systems, including:
- One ESP8266 board to control everything
- One MPU6050 module to get angle and speed of the rocket
- One CR2025 battery to give everything the power it needs

We are still working on this rocket, so we aren't giving the models yet, but we will in a few weeks!
